<h3>About the Gamma Distribution</h3>

- Gamma(1,$\lambda$)= Exponential($\lambda$)

- Special cases of the gamma distribution include the chi-square,
  erlang,and exponential distributions

- Closely approximates a normal distribution when $\kappa$ is large

- Poisson arrival times have gamma distributions

- It has an exponential right-hand tail
