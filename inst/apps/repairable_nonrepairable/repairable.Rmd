### Repairable systems

- Repairable systems may be represented graphically by a transition diagram with one or more transient states

    + The transient states represent failure modes for which the cost of repair is far below the cost of replacement

    + As result of the repair, the system can transition back to the operating state

- Repairable systems also have one or more absrbing states 

    + The absorbing states represent failure modes for which the cost of repair is equal to or greater than the cost of replacement

    + When these nonrepairable failure modes occur the system does not transition back to the operating state
