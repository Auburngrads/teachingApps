### Non-repairable systems are replaced - not repaired - upon failure

- <blue>Non safety critical & inexpensive</blue> items are often non-repairable since replacement is far cheaper than repair  

    + Light bulbs
    
    + Small appliances
    
    + Consumable items (filters, belts, hoses)

- <green>Safety critical & expensive</green> items may also be non-repairable if they must be replaced prior to failure when some degradation level is reached

    + Tires (tread depth)
    
    + Computers (processing speed, obsolescence)

- Non-repairable systems may be represented by a transition diagram with one working state and one or more absorbing failure states

    + State 0: Initial working state

    + States 1, 2,...: Absorbing failed states
