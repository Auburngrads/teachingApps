## The <green>normal</green>, <red>lognormal</red>, and <blue>Weibull</blue> distributions

- Each of these distributions have two parameters

- Analytic solutions for find MLE's <focus>do not</focus> exist for all two-parameter distributions 

- Graphical approaches for two-parameter distributions result in three dimensional likelihood surfaces - can be difficult to interpret 

- Numerical techniques are preferred <focus>and are often required</focus> to find the MLE's for distributions with 2 or more unknown parameters 

- The shiny app below shows the likelihood surfaces and the numerical solutions for each of these three distributions
